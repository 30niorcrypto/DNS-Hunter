# 🎯 DNS Hunter

**DNS Hunter** is a powerful and lightweight PowerShell script designed to help network researchers and users find "Clean" DNS nodes within a specific subnet. By using multi-threading, it quickly verifies if a DNS server resolves popular domains (like WhatsApp/Meta) without interference or strict filtering.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Parallel Processing:** Uses `RunspacePool` for high-speed scanning (50 threads).
- **Deep Verification:** Checks against specific IP ranges to ensure the node is truly clean.
- **Minimalist UI:** Clean and colored output for better readability.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Runs natively on Windows PowerShell.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Download the `DNS_Hunter.ps1` file.
2. Right-click and select **Run with PowerShell** (or run as Administrator for best results).
3. Enter the target subnet (e.g., `1.1.1` or `2.188.21`).
